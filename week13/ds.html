        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this study, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Articulate the strengths and weaknesses of common data structures in various scenarios.</p></li>
        </ol>  

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <h4>Preparation Material</h4>

        <p>Please read the following:</p>

        <h4>Testing your program</h4>
        <p>An automated testBed script not available for your program. Instead please manually test your program and ensure that it works correctly.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>You are encouraged to work with others on the programming and the quiz.</p>

        <p>When you have a good understanding of this data structure and have completed the programming project, take the accompanying I-Learn Quiz. It has questions about how the data structure works, and also, has places for your to report on the parts of the programming assignment that you completed.</p>
