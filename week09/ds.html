        <p class="subtitle">Hashing and Hash Tables</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this study, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Articulate the strengths and weaknesses of Hashing and Hash Tables.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use Hash Tables (sets and dictionaries) in Python to solve problems.</p></li>
        </ol>  

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Hashing and Hash Tables turn out to be some of the most useful tools from data structures.</p>

        <h4>Preparation Material</h4>

        <p>Please read the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/SortSearch/Hashing.html" target="_blank">Hashing</a> from Interactive Python. You may skip over 5.5.3 "Implementing the Map Abstract Data Type".</p></li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Using Hash Tables in Python</h3>
        <p>In Python, the built-in Sets and Dictionaries are each implemented using Hash Tables. (They could also be implemented using Balanced Binary Search Trees with <code>O(log n)</code> insertion, removal, and lookup time.)</p>

        <h4>Sets</h4>
        <p>A Set is a useful data structure when you are interested in knowing whether something is or is not a member of a collection of items, but are not concerned with maintaining a particular order.</p>

        <p>For example, we may have a set of participants who are registered for a event, and we want to know if someone has registered or not, but the order they registered is not important.</p>

        <p>For more details about how to create and use sets, please read the brief section on Sets from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" target="_blank">the official Python documentation</a>.</p>

        <h4>Dictionaries</h4>
        <p>Dictionaries are also commonly referred to as Tables or Maps. They provide a mapping from a key to a value. For example, consider a dictionary that contained the phone numbers of our friends:</p>

<pre><code class="Python">
# The dictionary can be created like so:
phone_numbers = {}

# New numbers can be added like this:
phone_numbers["Jenny"] = "(555) 867-5309"

# Phone numbers can be looked up, like this:
print(phone_numbers["Jenny"])
</code></pre>

        <p>Notice that in a way, this is just like using an array or a list, except that the index is now a meaningful string (or another type of object, if we would like). Also, notice, that if a second number were assigned to the same key, it would not store both, but rather would overwrite the value:</p>

<pre><code class="Python">
# First add one number
phone_numbers["Jenny"] = "(555) 867-5309"

# Now set a different number for Jenny
phone_numbers["Jenny"] = "(555) 123-4567"

# In this case, the second number has replaced the first one
# Thus, printing it out, will show "(555) 123-4567"

print(phone_numbers["Jenny"]) # This shows only the second value, "(555) 123-4567"

</code></pre>


        <p>As another example, we could have a dictionary that contains the state capital for each state. This could be declared as used as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="Python">
capitals = {}
capitals["Idaho"] = "Boise"
capitals["Utah"] = "Salt Lake City"
capitals["California"] = "Sacramento"
# ... other states here ...

state = input("Enter a state name: ")
capital = capitals[state]

print("The capital of {} is {}".format(state, capital))
</code></pre>

        <p>Obviously, we would want to do additional things here, such as check to see that the state existed, before printing it out. And, we may even want to loop through all of the states and print out their capitals. These things and more can all be done with dictionaries. For more details on using dictionaries, please read the brief section on Dictionaries from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" target="_blank">the official Python documentation</a>.</p>

        <h3>Homework Assignment</h3>
        <p>Use a recursive function to visit each node in a provided tree, and print out the values in order.</p>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>Follow these steps to guide you through the process:</p>

<pre><code class="Python">
</code></pre>


        <h4>Testing your program</h4>
        <p>An automated testBed script not available for your program. Instead please manually test your program and ensure that it works correctly.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>You are encouraged to work with others on the programming and the quiz.</p>

        <p>When you have a good understanding of this data structure and have completed the programming project, take the accompanying I-Learn Quiz. It has questions about how the data structure works, and also, has places for your to report on the parts of the programming assignment that you completed.</p>
